Description: This is a game named "Karting Micrograme," which is a Karting car racing game. The goal for the player is to manipulate the karting car, to cross the ramps and checkpoints, and to arrvie the destination within the limit time. According to the tutorials and "Karting Mod," we changed the colors of the cars and adjusted the parameters of the gameplayer. Meanwhile we also added the time limits, jumping ramps and checkpoints in specific places. And then adjust their sizes, angles, placement and the celebration visual effects when the player drove and crossed the checkpoints, and finally gained time rewards. Moreover, we also modified the game tracks to give more possiblities and optimized the game scene to make it more attractive.
